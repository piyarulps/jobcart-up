Only individuals to whom the Job Seeker has filed an application or sent their CV have access to private resumes. Even if Your Resume's privacy setting is set to Private, it may be duplicated and distributed if You apply for employment or otherwise share it with employers. You may modify the privacy settings for Your Resume at any time; however, changing Your Resume to private will not affect your prior applications or prevent responding employers from contacting you. Public Resumes, including yours, may be replicated by search engines and other third parties with access to the Site, who can subsequently make them publicly accessible elsewhere. Jobcart lacks control over such third parties. If Your Resume is duplicated in this fashion, making it private on Jobcart will have no effect on these third parties or the copies they have produced. Changes made to Your Resume on the Site may or might not reflect on copies produced by third parties. If You never want Your Resume to be accessible to the public or copied, you must keep it set to private.

Jobcart may also highlight credentials in Your Resume that match those in the Job Ad, as well as qualifications in the Job Ad that is absent from Your Resume. These highlights do not indicate whether you are qualified for the position or if you should apply for it.

If you do not want Jobcart to make your Jobcart Profile visible to other parties or if you do not want Employers to contact you, you may make your Jobcart Resume and uploaded file resume private or erase Your Resume. Your assessment results will be paired with your Jobcart Profile. You have the option of making your Jobcart Assessment answer visible to Employers who read your Jobcart Profile. You may activate the ready to work option on your profile to indicate to Employers that you are available to begin work immediately. After a specific period of time, Jobcart may deactivate this function from your profile, but you may manually enable it again.
            Jobcart may mask or conceal your contact information, such as your email address and/or phone number, from Your Jobcart Profile, Your Resume, or application, and may replace it with an alias in order to prevent fraud. Jobcart does not guarantee that any or all of your contact information will be disguised or concealed, and the decision to mask or hide such information rests solely with Jobcart.

Jobcart may, in its sole discretion, place restrictions on your ability to apply to Job Listings or other Jobcart services in order to preserve the quality of the Site and Services.
            <br/><br/>You accept that before submitting a Jobcart Apply application, you are responsible for checking that you are applying to the appropriate Employer.

If you wish the Employer to remove, alter, or keep such information confidential, you must make the request directly to the Employer. The unsubscribing from calls from Employers through Jobcart does not affect already arranged interviews. Jobcart is not responsible for the application procedure of Employers, thus if you want different application techniques, you must contact the Employer directly.
            <br/><br/>When you request Jobcart to submit your application or other information through Jobcart Apply, you are sending Jobcart Your Resume and application information, and requesting and authorizing Jobcart to make such application information available to the applicable Employer(s) for the indicated Job Listing (s). You also consent to Jobcart's automatic processing of your application, since such processing is fundamental to this Agreement.

In addition, you agree to Jobcart processing and analyzing your application and any answers given to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Jobcart in accordance with this Agreement and Jobcart's Privacy Policy.

Jobcart will try to send your application to the contact information supplied by an Employer or their Agent when you apply for a job using Jobcart Apply. This may involve sending your application to an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or other service provider designated by the Employer. You agree that Employers may let third-party service providers access and administer their Jobcart accounts, including by connecting to and integrating with Jobcart's APIs. By submitting a job application through Jobcart, you consent to the Employer's use of such service providers and recognize that such usage may include an intermediary having access to job applications delivered to its Employer client. Such communications and applications are not guaranteed to be delivered, received, accessed, read, or acted upon. Jobcart does not promise that any Employer will receive, be informed of, access, read, or react to such resumes or other application materials, nor does it guarantee that there will be no transmission or storage errors. Jobcart relies on the Employer or the Employer's agent to give Jobcart the right destination for all applications; nevertheless, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the contact information supplied by Employers. If the electronic address supplied to Jobcart is wrong, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient. In addition, Jobcart does not guarantee that the interface will be free of errors. Nevertheless, Jobcart may notify you when any of the aforementioned occurrences occur.
            <br/><br/>Please be aware that Job Ads may expire between the time your application is submitted and the time it is received. Jobcart is not responsible for expired Job Ads or for sending applications prior to the expiry of a Job Ad, and Jobcart and its third-party suppliers may keep your application and associated information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer accessible on the Site. We cannot guarantee the technological capabilities of any third-party website, including but not limited to applicant tracking systems. Employer-utilized ATSs and third-party sites may disclaim responsibility for technological failures, including the inability to transmit applications. We are not liable if an applicant tracking system rejects or fails to transmit a resume to an employer for whatever reason. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored by Jobcart on Jobcart's or third-party providers' servers, please do not use the Jobcart Apply or Jobcart relay functions and instead send your application or messages directly to the Employer via the public mail system or any other method you choose. If you do not desire to apply via Jobcart, you may contact the Employer directly to discuss other application options. By using the Jobcart Apply system, you agree to the aforementioned terms in full.
            <br/><br/>By using Jobcart, you agree that Jobcart is not responsible for the Employer's job application, messages, screener questions, skills assessments, or their format or method of delivery, and that Jobcart does not guarantee that the Employer will receive your application or that you will receive messages from the Employer. Please be aware that Jobcart does not choose the questions posed by Employers or determine their employment qualification standards. Employers are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar statutes, anti-discrimination statutes such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and any applicable data protection or privacy statutes.

Jobcart does not guarantee the veracity of a job offer, and Job Seekers are cautioned to confirm the validity of a job offer before making any changes to their present work conditions. It is the exclusive responsibility of the Employment Seeker to confirm the veracity of any Employer or job offer.
            <br/><br/>By utilizing Jobcart Apply and responding to screener questions, you accept that Employers may have authorized Jobcart to send rejection notifications if your responses do not match the answers desired by the Employer, and that Jobcart has no discretion in the delivery of these rejections. Jobcart may provide Employers with the option to enable an Employer Assist function on their account. Employer Assist is activated when the Employer instructs Jobcart to send a message to the Job Seeker advising them that the Employer has decided not to go further with their application. These notifications are issued automatically after an Employer-specified length of time unless the Employer expresses interest in your application to Jobcart. You understand and accept that Jobcart has no control over the transmission of these communications and that any such messages are purely the consequence of the Employer's choice to activate Employer Assist and not to take action on your application on Jobcart within the Employer-specified time frame.

Jobcart has no responsibility for the content, correctness, authenticity, completeness, legality, dependability, or availability of any Employer Assist messages and disclaims all obligations in this regard.
            <br/><br/>By using Jobcart Apply and responding to screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Jobcart to schedule interviews with Job Seekers who meet criteria (based on information the Job Seeker has provided to Jobcart, such as responses to screener questions, resume, and Jobcart Assessment Responses), and based on Employers' availability. You accept that Jobcart has no control over the transmission or storage of these interview invites (which are entirely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Employer's specified availability or selection criteria may not be true. Before arranging an interview, Jobcart may require that Job Seekers affirm their interest in the post. It is ultimately your and the Employer's obligation to check if any interviews have been set, as well as to reschedule or cancel interviews as required. The choice of who to interview is made completely by the Employer, who may opt to conduct an interview with any Job Seeker at any time.
            Jobcart may propose information from your Jobcart profile to add to your application when you look for opportunities on the Jobcart Job Search app and continue to apply for a job, including positions on third-party sites. You are responsible for reviewing ideas before accepting and incorporating them into your application.

                <li>It is your responsibility to acquire, at your own expense, all of the necessary hardware and telecommunications services in order to get access to and make use of the Platform.</li>

                <li>
                    Unless you are a live-in landlord looking for a lodger, if you are a user and want to post an advertisement for a room or property to rent in Scotland, then regardless of whether you may be allowed by law to advertise or rent a room or property in Scotland without the following, for the purposes of advertising a room or property to rent in Scotland on this Platform, you must either:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Be registered in the Canadian Landlords Register and keep it up to date; or</li>
                        <li>Have filled out a valid application and pay the fee to get on the Canadian Landlords Register, and have never:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A Canadian Landlord Registration has been taken off the Canadian Landlords Register or has been revoked; or</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We reserve the right to ask you for proof of the above at any time or to ask the local authority for confirmation. We also reserve the right to temporarily close an account until we get the proof and/or confirmation we need.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            
            <br/><br/><h5>3. Posting and responding to ads on the Platform</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>All advertisements placed on the Platform must be for residential rentals only and adhere to all applicable laws.</li>
                <li>In order to produce and publish an ad (sometimes referred to as a "listing") on the Platform, you must first register an account with us. You can only ever submit one ad/listing for rooms and/or properties to rent on the Platform at a time when you sign up for a free account. You can upgrade your account so that you can simultaneously publish more ads/listings for rooms and/or homes up for rent. You have a "listing allowance," or the number of times you can submit a new ad/listing or reactivate an expired ad/listing in a rolling 28-day period, that determines how many rental rooms and/or property adverts you can put on the Platform at any given time. The number of advertising or listings you are permitted to post on the Platform at any given moment is multiplied by three to determine the listing allowance that applies to you. For instance, the free account allows you to post one ad or listing, giving you a total of three listings. In other words, you are allowed to change your ad or listing three times within a rolling 28-day period, or renew it if it expires. You would have a listing allowance of 15 if you upgraded your account to allow you to publish 5 advertisements or listings at once. This would allow you to replace your existing ads or listings with new ones or reactivate them 15 times if they expire. Your listing allowance may be applied to any or all of your ads or listings as you see fit. For instance, it may be applied in whole to a single ad or listing, divided among two or three, or applied to all of your advertising or listings. Your listing allowance is unaffected by actions other than posting new ads or listings or reactivating expired ones, such as modifying active ads or listings. Please see the FAQ section for further information on the listing allowance.</li>
                <li>On the Platform, there are two different sorts of ads that may be uploaded. The first is an advertisement that any regular, non-paying member who has created an account with us may post (a "Free Ad"). Members who have paid to upgrade their accounts are the only ones who may publish the second form of ad, known as "Bold Ads." On the search results pages, bold ads are highlighted in blue and are displayed above similarly aged free ads. Please see the FAQ section for more information on the advantages of bold ads.</li>
                <li>Click the "Post ad" link on the homepage and follow the instructions to post an advertisement on the platform. You are representing and warranting (which is a legal guarantee) us by publishing an advertisement on the Platform that:
                    <ol>
                        <li>To the best of your knowledge and belief, all the information you present in your advertisement will be accurate and not in any way misleading;</li>
                        <li>Any images or videos you use to advertise your room(s) or property(ies) will be current and accurate depictions of those items;</li>
                        <li>You are fully authorized to promote, rent, or otherwise lease the relevant room or property (please note that we reserve the right to require documentation of such authorizations); and</li>
                        <li>All advertisements will adhere to these Terms, including clause 7.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>You may not:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place several advertisements for the same room or property;</li>
                        <li>Publish fictitious or fraudulent advertisements for houses or rooms that aren't available for rent or viewing;</li>
                        <li>Removing an advertisement and reposting it to make it look to be "New Today"; or</li>
                        <li>After you have used up your listing allocation in any rolling 28-day period, replace your ad or listing with a new one, or revive it if it expires (as explained in clause 4.2).</li>            
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in any ads you publish to the Platform are your responsibility, as any other content in such ads. Regarding the content of any adverts put on our Platform, we accept no responsibility toward you or anyone else. We suggest that you examine your ad's content as soon as you upload it to the Platform to make sure you are satisfied with it. By entering into your account and selecting the My Ads option, you can at any moment change or remove any ads you have posted on the Platform. Please see the FAQ section for further information on how to accomplish this.</li>
                <li>For the first seven days after a Free Ad has been posted on the Platform, starting on the day it was initially published, only users who have paid to upgrade their accounts to acquire "Early Bird Access" will be able to reply to that ad. Any registered user of the Platform may respond to an advertisement via the Platform after it has been up for seven days or more. All logged-in users have immediate access to Bold Ads.</li>
                <li>You consent to contact advertisers solely through the legitimate "contact advertiser" alternatives that are provided on each ad. You must not utilize any contact information that is either disguised behind images or is included in the text of an advertisement for your own protection.</li>
                <li>You can communicate with other Platform users through our in-house messaging system. Please be aware, nevertheless, that we will never share any of our members' contact information or other private information without their express consent. Our on-site messaging system is not routinely monitored by us, but we reserve the right to do so in order to investigate any suspected violations of our terms and conditions, any illegal activity, any other unauthorized use of our service, or for any other reasonable reason as may be determined from time to time. Messages sent through our platform's messaging system may be archived or deleted at our discretion after at least fifty-six (56) days, or sooner if we believe the message to be inappropriate or illegal.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to refuse to list or deactivate any advertisements or alter any User Generated Content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or that we are ordered by a court, law enforcement agency, or regulatory body to refuse to list or deactivate. There won't be any refunds in these situations. In order to post adverts and/or other user-generated content, we have the right to ask for verification of your authorization. We reserve the right to temporarily suspend or deactivate (with or without notice) any ad or account in question while we investigate the situation in the event that we: (a) receive any complaints about an ad or advertiser; (b) learn that law enforcement or regulatory agency is looking into an ad or advertiser, or (c) otherwise learn of any violation of these Terms or any illegal activity carried out by an advertiser.</li>
                <li>We reserve the right to upload any ads you post to the Platform to other relevant portal websites from time to time, such as other third-party property search websites, in addition to publishing them across the Jobcart network of websites. We never publish users' contact information along with their adverts on outside websites.</li>
                <li>We offer the option for all users to renew their advertising. Renewing places your ad at the top of the New listings and reposts the ad back into the listings as New. Your ad won't be posted back as New Today after renewing. The amount of newer, or more recently posted Boosted and/or Renewed advertising affects the search results in your Renewed ad displays, as well as its position on that page. Please see our FAQ section for a detailed explanation of how adverts are ranked on Jobcart. The 7-day Early Bird period is restarted when an advertisement is renewed.</li>
                <li>A public profile of the advertiser is included in every ad on the platform. You agree that details about your age and gender will be included in your profile when you place an advertisement. Please email the customer care staff at career@jobcart.ca if you would like to update any of the information on your profile.</li>
            </ol>
        
        
        
            <br/><br/><h5>4. Upgrading your account</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>At any moment, you can upgrade your account by selecting the "Upgrade" link under "My Account" on our Platform. Your listing allowance (described in paragraph 4.2) will rise in line with any upgrade that allows you to post more advertising or listings at once (taking into account any part of the allowance already used in the current rolling 28-day period).</li>
                <li>Please visit our Platform's Upgrade section for additional information on the various upgrade choices available and available payment methods.</li>
                <li>If you decide to upgrade your account, we'll bill you for the upgrading period you've selected. Payments can be made using Paypal or any other payment method that may occasionally be promoted on the Platform, or they can be processed by our third-party payment processor, which is currently Stripe or Worldpay, utilizing their secure server.</li>
                <li>Unless you choose to prolong your upgrade period by making further payments, your account will automatically revert to our free service at the conclusion of your upgrade period. Your listing allowance (as described in paragraph 4.2) will be modified to reflect the decrease in the number of ads/listings when any upgrade that included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any given time expires and your account reverts to our free service. You will only be billed for the time period you want to upgrade. You are not giving us permission to automatically prolong your upgrade period by providing us with your payment card information unless you specifically chose to do so as part of a monthly subscription package, including any activated auto top-up of money for our Featured Ads service (as explained in clause 6.1 (a)).</li>
                <li>All monthly membership plans are regarded as ongoing as of the purchase date.</li>
                <li>A contract for improved services between you and us will have been formed once you have paid the payment to upgrade your account and we have sent you a confirmation email confirming your purchase. Your stated request for us to start providing the pertinent services after we issue the confirmation email will be interpreted as your payment confirmation. According to the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges Regulations) 2013, you have up to 14 days after the contract's formation to cancel your agreement for improved services (the "Regulations"). You must let us know that you're canceling in order to exercise your right to do so. You can do this by filling out the cancellation form that is available on the Platform and sending it to us via email, phone, or mail. Your listing allowance (as described in clause 4.2) will be adjusted to reflect the decrease in the number of ads/listings when any upgrade that included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any given time is canceled and your account returns to our free service or an alternative upgrade that includes a lower number of ads/listings you can post at any given time. Please be aware that once you begin making use of our improved service, you will not be eligible for a complete refund and that we may charge you a pro-rata sum for any services you have already received in accordance with the Regulations. Depending on when you decide to cancel your contract, the amount you receive as a refund will be determined as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>You will be charged a pro-rata sum for each day or fraction of a day of your subscription period that you have used if you cancel your purchase within the first seven days of your contract with us and while your upgrade is still active. If you wait until the upgrade has already passed its expiration date to contact us to cancel it, you won't be able to get a refund for it.</li>
                        <li>The pro rata amount you will be charged will be based on the full price for a 7-day upgrade, meaning that for each day or portion of a day that you have used, 1/7th of the price of a 7-day upgrade will be subtracted from the total you have paid and the remaining amount will be reimbursed to you;</li>
                        <li>A "day" is defined as a full 24 hours commencing from the moment we provide you confirmation of your upgrade purchase in order to determine the amount to be reimbursed;</li>
                        <li>To be clear, any cancellation requests made during the first 24 hours of your contract will be subject to a one-day fee; requests made after 24 hours but before 48 hours have passed will be subject to a two-day fee, and so on; and</li>
                        <li>If you decide to cancel your order after 7 days but before the end of the 14-day cooling-off period, we'll charge you the full price of a 7-day subscription period but refund the rest of your money.</li>
                        <li>If you use any extra services included with your purchase, you will additionally be charged a prorated fee for those extra services.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Cancellations of monthly membership plans take effect on the day after your next payment is due. This has no bearing on your ability to cancel in accordance with paragraph 5 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (the "Regulations"). 6. Your listing allowance (as described in clause 4.2) will be adjusted to reflect the decrease in the number of ads/listings when any monthly subscription package that included an increase in the number of ads/listings you could post at any one time is canceled and your account reverts to our free service or an alternative upgrade that includes a lower number of ads/listings you can post at any one time.</li>
                <li>Users who change their monthly subscription package may, at our discretion, get a pro-rata refund based on any leftover services not utilized during the ongoing monthly subscription period. The time left until the subsequent payment date and any Boosts used during that period will be utilized to determine the amount payable. You will not be qualified for a pro-rata refund when changing your subscription if all allotted Boosts have been used up within the active monthly term. This has no bearing on your ability to cancel in accordance with clause 5.6 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (the "Regulations").</li>
                <li>Should all of the Boosts have been used before we receive your request to cancel, the number of Boosts used will be given a monetary value up to and including the value of your entire monthly payment in order to determine a pro-rata refund. If there are still Boosts available, the total value of the refund will be reduced by the number of Boosts that have been utilized.</li>
                <li>If a higher listing subscription plan makes more than 7 Boosts accessible to you, the amount deducted will increase incrementally for each Boost up to and including the value of your entire monthly payment should all Boosts have been used.</li>
                <li>Annual subscription plans cannot be changed or decreased. However, at our discretion, we might permit a user to cancel an annual package in favor of a different professional upgrade package in order to raise their overall number of listings. In these situations, a pro-rata refund based on the utilization of the previous month will be determined for the remaining time. The volume of Boosts used during the previous month will be utilized to determine how much will be refunded. In order to prevent confusion, the month period will begin on the day of purchase. At the time of cancellation, the new higher listing upgrade package must be paid for. This has no bearing on your ability to cancel in accordance with clause 5.6 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (the "Regulations").</li>
                <li>Refunds will be processed using your original payment method and will typically take 7 working days.</li>
                <li>Please be aware that once your contract for an upgraded subscription has been fully fulfilled, in the event of a contract for a 7-day subscription period will be after the end of the 7-day period, you will no longer be able to cancel your membership.</li>

            <br/><br/><h5>5. Additional features for room and/or property advertisers</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Members of the Platform who are marketing rooms and/or properties are the only ones to whom this clause of these Terms applies. Members of the Platform advertising rooms and/or properties may choose to utilize some of the extra features and services we provide to those advertising rooms and/or properties as described in this section of these Terms if they have registered an account with us and are paying for an upgraded subscription service.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Featured Ads:
                            <ol>
                                <li>You can utilize our pay-per-click system to give your adverts more prominence in search results. Search results are often shown according to how relevant they are to the user's search query. However, we also enable Platform users to choose their own pay-per-click costs for promoting their advertisements in advertising spaces and/or properties (the "PPC Rate"). Such pay-per-click advertisements will be given more prominence than regular advertisements. On a decreasing scale, the ads with the highest PPC Rate set for the pertinent search phrases will be given the most prominence in the search listings.</li>
                                <li>Once chosen, your account must have a balance of funds in the positive for the Featured Ads service to be operational. The Featured Ads service will continue to function if your account has a positive money balance, but if that amount is inadequate to pay your PPC Rate, any clicks on your advertisement will still apply your selected PPC Rate and your account will enter a negative balance. The Featured Ads service will be instantly deleted and your ads will revert to being regular ads if there are no funds in your account, including any negative amount.</li>
                                <li>Funds for the Featured Ads service (minimum of $10) can be manually contributed to your account at any time using our third-party payment processor, Stripe, utilizing their secure server, or by using PayPal or any other payment method as may be occasionally offered on the Platform.</li>
                                <li>Additionally, we provide an auto-top-up feature on the iOS App and the website (www.JobCart.ca) whereby, when the funds in your account reach $0 or you have a negative balance (as stated in (ii) above), they are automatically topped up using your preferred debit or credit card by the pre-selected amount (either when you set the feature up or subsequently). The Android App and PayPal do not support the auto top-up option.</li>
                                <li>The lowest and maximum amounts that can be specified for the automatic top-up feature are respectively $10 and $1,000. The daily spend cap you set will continue to determine how much money you may spend on the Featured Ads program.</li>
                                <li>In the event that your account has a negative balance (as described in (ii) above), any money added manually or via the auto-top-up option will first eliminate the negative balance before crediting your account with any residual cash. If $10 is added to an account with a negative balance of 5cents, for instance, the account balance will display as $9.95.</li>
                                <li>You can disable the auto top-up function at any moment through the Platform by going to "payments" in the "My Account" Featured Ads area and following the guidelines.</li>
                                <li>To seek the return of monies in your account that are no longer needed for the Featured Ads Service or to learn more about the Featured Ads service, send an email to career@jobcart.ca or give a call at 647-360-7800.</li>

                        <li>Boosts:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Boosts are used to move your advertising back to the very top of the listings and can be used for new ads or ads that have been inactive for seven days. The advertisement is Boosted for 24 hours after being applied. The number of New Today and/or Boosted ads submitted to Jobcart after your Boost was applied determines the search results page your Boosted ad appears on and its position on that page. Please see the FAQ section for a detailed explanation of how adverts are ranked on Jobcart.</li>
                                <li>You can use boosts on many ads or the same ad multiple times throughout a week, but you can only use one boost on the same ad. For a period of 24 hours after a Boost has been successfully applied to an advertisement, it cannot be halted or applied to another advertisement. See clause 4.12 for a description of our Renew feature.</li>
                                <li>Some subscription bundles (as listed on our Platform) come standard with a number of Boosts. In these cases, 50% of the monthly listings in your package, rounded to the nearest whole number, is the number of Boosts that will be added to your account. A user with 10 listings, for instance, receives 5 boosts per month, whereas a user with 5 listings, receives 2. Each month on the date of your membership payment, the amount of Boosts that are a part of your subscription package and are available for usage is reset. You cannot store or carry over any unused Boosts that are automatically included in your subscription package.</li>
                                <li>Boosts can be purchased through the "My ads" part of our Platform or via the link on your ad panel if you have an upgrade or subscription package that does not automatically include them or if you desire more Boosts that are already included in your subscription package. Purchases of boosters made in accordance with this article 6.1(b)(iv): I am usable after the expiration or termination of your upgrade or subscription package up to the Boost expiry date; and (ii) are good for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase (and expiry dates for these Boosts may be found in the "My advertising" part of our Platform). Any Boosts that aren't used within a year after purchase expire and are no longer usable.</li>
                                <li>For more information on Boosts and how they work, please contact customer services at 647-360-7800.</li>

                </li>
            </ol>
        
        
            <br/><br/><h5>5. Use and access of the Service</h5>
            No commercial activity, unless contractually agreed upon by JobCart.
            <br/><br/>The Service is solely confined to providing a means for private Ridesharing between Drivers and Passengers. Unless otherwise agreed upon in a contract with JobCart, the Services may not be used to offer or accept Carpooling for profit or in any business or professional setting.
            <br/><br/>Drivers are not permitted to profit from any Trip. The Service and the cost Contribution may only be used to cover the Driver's expenses, not to earn a profit. The Driver has no right to profit based on the amount of the Trip Contribution, the kinds of Trips given, the frequency of such Trips, or the number of Passengers carried. This applies to all activities, arrangements, and services booked through the Service, as well as any additional services or activities agreed upon by the Driver and Passenger.
            <br/><br/>The Driver may not offer extra services to a Passenger for profit or benefit, including (but not limited to) package delivery, waiting time, additional drop-off and pick-up places, and collecting more passengers. The Passenger may not accept or request such services (other than the Passenger).
            <br/><br/>All Trips and pick-up and drop-off locations must be arranged in advance via the Service. Drivers are not permitted to pick up Passengers from any place that has not been pre-arranged with the Passengers through the Service.
            <br/><br/>Drivers may NOT post speculative trips. To guarantee that Passengers get a dependable service, drivers may only submit excursions if they are 100 percent certain of their journey details.
            <br/><br/>Drivers are advised that utilizing the Service for business or professional purposes may render their insurance void. JobCart's liability is limited in accordance with these Terms of Service, and in particular, JobCart is not liable for any breach of any agreement between Members or breach of these Terms of Service by a Member, including where any Driver (in violation of these Terms of Service) offers professional or commercial services through the Service (thereby potentially invalidating their insurance). Members are responsible for ensuring that no services are supplied on a commercial basis.
            <br/><br/>JobCart doesn't offer transport services. The Service provides a communications platform for Members to engage in business transactions. JobCart has no effect on Trips, destinations, or schedules. The Carpooling agreement is between the Driver and Passenger. JobCart is not a party to any agreement or transaction between Members, nor is it accountable for any problem arising between Members about a Booking. JobCart does not and will not act as a member's agent.
            Any violation of these Terms of Service may result in the immediate suspension of a Member's account and may prevent them from using the Services in the future.

                <li><b>Eligibility to use the Service</b>
                    JobCart is a ridesharing service that enables users to connect with one another and plan rides. The Passenger is required to get in touch with the Driver through the JobCart service to set up a Rideshare and any further travel requirements (including the size of luggage, equipment, etc).
                    <br/><br/>JobCart has the power to determine whether a Member is eligible to utilize the Rideshare service, and as a result, JobCart retains the right to discontinue that service at any time for any Member.
                </li>
                <li><b>Conditions under which the Service is provided:</b>
                    JobCart reserves the right to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stop providing the Service and limit it to a group of Members and/or a small number of locations.</li>

                    </ol>

            </ol>
        
            
            <br/><br/><h5>6. Features of the Service</h5>
            The Origin and Destination, Date and Time of Departure, Seats Available, and Any Other Relevant Information are provided by the Driver when proposing Trips on the Service.
            <br/><br/>The Driver proposing a Trip must be the principal driver of that Trip, and cannot assign the driving to another Driver. Prior to setting off on the trip, the passengers must be informed and give their consent if another driver will be sharing the driving duties.
            Passengers may communicate with the driver through messages and make reservations during a trip.
            
                <b>Messages</b>
                <br/>For the purpose of facilitating communication among JobCart Members, messaging service is offered. The JobCart messaging service supports the exchange of two different kinds of messages.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Public Messages</b>
                        Before a Booking is made, the Driver and the Passenger can communicate via public messages to go over the specifics of the Trip.
                        Other JobCart Members may see Public Messages because they provide information that may be useful to the JobCart community.</li>
                    <li><b>Private Messages</b>
                        Once a Booking has been established or if the Driver has asked a passenger to join their Trip, the Driver and the Passenger may communicate privately.
                        Only the Driver and the Passenger who is included in the communication may see private messages.
                        Please be aware that until a Booking has been accepted, we do not permit the transmission of personal contact information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, or website URLs, via the JobCart messaging service.</li>
                    <li><b>Bookings & Cancellations</b>
                        Only by getting in touch with the Driver may the Passenger reserve one or more seats via the Service. JobCart does not participate in the Trip's payment procedure. This is the issue that the Driver and the Passenger must discuss and resolve. JobCart disclaims all liability for any harm resulting from cancellations made by the driver or the passenger.
                        The Driver and Passenger are notified of the Booking by emails, text messages, push notifications on their registered phones, and the JobCart app. The Booking is ineligible under any name other than the Member's registered name with the Service. After a Passenger makes a Booking, the Driver is obligated to finish the Trip as planned. The Driver is responsible for making sure the car has enough seats so that every passenger can buckle up securely.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Conditions for the Driver for pickup</b><br/><br/>
                        During a trip involving a driver and one or more passengers, the Driver must:<br/>
                        <br/>a) Arrive at the pick-up location five (5) minutes early.
                        <br/>b) Before leaving, provide notice to all passengers who have been authorized for a trip of any changes to the trip's itinerary that may have an impact on the passengers, including but not limited to adjustments to the pick-up or drop-off locations or the time of the trip. Prior to departure, if a Passenger objects to a modification on that Trip, they have the complete right to cancel their Booking without penalty and without paying any Contribution toward the Driver's expenses.
                        <br/>c) Up to 10 minutes after the scheduled pick-up time, wait for the passenger at the pickup location, and phone any unaccounted-for passengers before continuing without them.
                        <br/>d) Act as the primary Driver and transport the passenger to the predetermined and agreed-upon location in a safe manner.
                        e) Unless specifically permitted by JobCart, not be running a for-profit, commercial business.

                </ol>
        
                <b>Policies on cancellations, no-shows, and disputes</b>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Cancellations, no-shows, and disputes in general</b>
                        JobCart is not liable for any changes, no-shows, or disagreements between the Driver and the Passenger. JobCart is not responsible for any damages or losses incurred as a result of this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Driver Cancellation Policy</b><br/>
                        A driver is never fined for canceling a journey without authorized passengers.
                        The "cancellation allowance" allows a driver to cancel a maximum of one trip with authorized booking(s) or one approved booking per six months. The driver's JobCart account will be reviewed and potentially blocked if a second cancellation happens within the six months that follow the first one.
                        in the event that a driver cancels a trip (with authorized booking(s)), the following rules apply:
                        <ol>
                            <li>The driver's profile is automatically reviewed for cancellations.</li>
                            <li>If JobCart has cause to suspect a driver is giving other users a bad experience, it retains the right to ban the driver's account at any moment in the event of a cancellation.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
        
                <br/><br/><b>Driver No-show Policy</b><br/>
                A significant offense that might result in an automatic account cancellation is a driver who fails to show up for a journey with authorized passengers.
                <br/>When a passenger cancels throughout the course of a journey, the driver raises a concern with the JobCart team to learn more about the no-show:
                <ol>
                    <li>If the no-show cannot be confirmed or was made in error, it is rejected and the driver is not penalized.</li>
                    <li>If the no-show is confirmed and it is determined that the driver was not at fault, a no-show review is placed on their profile and their account is maintained active.</li>
                    <li>If the no-show is confirmed and the driver was at fault, our staff may post a no-show review to the driver's profile and ban the driver's account.</li>
                    <li>If JobCart has reason to believe a driver is giving other users a bad experience, it reserves the right to block that driver's account at any time in the case of a no-show.</li>
                </ol>    
        
                <br/><br/><b>Insurance</b><br/>
                The Driver accepts responsibility for insuring their vehicle in accordance with applicable laws and for verifying the validity of their insurance before each Trip. A current driver's license is also required for the Driver.
                <br/><br/>To your knowledge, it is often believed that in North America, passengers who contribute to the cost of a trip are protected by insurance plans.
                <br/><br/>It is the responsibility of each Driver and Passenger to confirm with their insurance provider that they are protected while carpooling.
                <br/><br/>It is also the responsibility of drivers who use company-issued cars to ensure that all passengers on a carpooling trip are covered by their insurance plans.
                <br/><br/>Both the Driver and the Passenger are made aware of the likelihood that their insurance providers would decline to pay for any damage sustained in an event while operating a private car for business, as shown in Section 3.1.
                <br/><br/>The Member acknowledges that JobCart is not responsible in any manner for any uncovered insurance claims that may arise from an accident and assumes full financial responsibility for them.
                JobCart retains the right to immediately suspend a Member's Account if it has reason to believe or is made aware that the Member is engaging in Service-related commercial activity as defined in Section 3.1. JobCart retains the right to report any unlawful conduct carried out through the Service to the appropriate authorities.
        
                <br/><br/><b>Litigations & conflicts</b><br/>
                Members may report disputes and settle legal matters using the contact us area of JobCart.
                <br/><br/>While JobCart makes every effort to respond to requests promptly, it is not obligated to resolve all disputes that may occur between Members while using the Service.
                <br/><br/>JobCart is not accountable for any disputes between the Driver and the Passenger that are not resolved.
